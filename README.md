# 2D_colours_matrix
Task for a program that finds the longest adjacent sequence of colorus in a matrix(2D grid)

That programme was created according to a task  which you can find in the pdf file. 

For the solution, I used a C language, with MAKE file and shared object, and a simple python script to run the program.  
Into README file (not README.md) You can find an instruction to run the program.
